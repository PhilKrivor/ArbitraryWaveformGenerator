# Arbitrary Waveform Generator

This simple project aims to create an arbitrary waveform generator using the following base components: 

1. A DAC for actually creating the voltages
2. An FPGA for driving the DAC

The project aims to have the following (loosely) defined parameters: 

1. A max output frequency above 10 MHz
2. A drive current of above 100 mA
3. Rail-to-rail operation with voltages up to +-12V (not particularly important but a nice to have)
